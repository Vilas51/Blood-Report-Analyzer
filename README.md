# Project Setup and Execution Guide
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ronit33/blood-test-analyser.git
```
## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To begin, we will create a Conda environment. Open your terminal and run:
```sh
conda create -n wingify_assignment python=3.10 -y
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries
After creating the environment, activate it and install the necessary libraries by running:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
While the libraries are installing, we need to set up our environment variables.

Create a ```.env``` File
In the project directory, create a new file named ``.env`` Add your environment variables to this file in the following format:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
SERPER_API_KEY="YOUR_SERPER_API_KEY"
```

* Obtain API Keys

    - Serper API Key: Obtain your API key from [Serper API Key](https://serper.dev/api-key).
